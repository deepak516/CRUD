Employee Data Management System

This project is my first endeavor into Java programming, focusing on practicing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It features a simple yet effective employee data management system where I've implemented functionalities like storing employee names, employee numbers, and their salaries.

**Key Learning Points:**
- Utilizing getter and setter methods for data manipulation
- Accessing and working with data objects efficiently
- Calling methods to perform specific tasks
- Understanding method overriding for customized behavior
- Handling data storage and retrieval using ArrayLists in various scenarios

Through this project, I've gained valuable insights into core Java concepts, object-oriented programming practices, and handling data structures effectively.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
